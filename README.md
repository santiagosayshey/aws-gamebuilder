## **Wildcards**

   - Duplicate: Copies a random wildcard from another player.
   - Extra Bet: Doubles the bet without extra funds after seeing the initial hand.
   - Safe Hit: Draw a card without busting, even if it would exceed 21.  
   - Second Chance: Grants another turn if a player busts.
   - Tycoon: Doubles the player's bankroll instantly.
   - Foresight: Peeks at the next card in the deck to aid in decision-making.
   - Swap Hands: Swaps the player's hand with another player's or the dealer's.
